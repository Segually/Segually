# Welcome to my Profile!

My name is Segual! I'm passionate about creating videos, games, whatever I feel like! I am a huge fan of the game "Super Bear Adventure" aswell.

## Here is what I Do :
1. game development : even though i'm trash at it, sometimes i try to make games, even if they don't turn out well! ðŸ˜…
2. content creation : i make videos, even sometimes containing animations!
3. animation, i use the popular 3d program called "blender" to create my animations
4. gaming : yes, i do gaming, i play a bit of minecraft and roblox once in a whileðŸ˜Ž

that's pretty much all there is to say, i guess?
